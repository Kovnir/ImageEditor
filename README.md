# ImageEditor
Lightweight library for image manipulation on .NET

Integration sample you can find in Sample.cs

Library was developed as part of diploma. That include three more parts:
[Delbluring libruary](github.com/xsimbvx/ImageRecovery), [Integration sample](github.com/xsimbvx/IRIntegration) and [Modification of delbluring algorithms](github.com/xsimbvx/DeblurModification).

Develoment is over, but if you have interesting ideas, or think, that some methods work bad or just slow - let me know it!
